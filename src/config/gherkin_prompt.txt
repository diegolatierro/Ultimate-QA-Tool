Generate a Gherkin test scenario for the login functionality of a web application.

Include two scenarios:
1. A successful login scenario where the user is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
2. A failed login scenario with invalid credentials, where the user receives an error message indicating "Invalid email or password."

Example:
Scenario: Failed Login with Invalid Credentials
  Given the user navigates to the login page
  When the user enters an invalid email and password
  And the user clicks on the login button
  Then the user should see an error message "Invalid email or password"
